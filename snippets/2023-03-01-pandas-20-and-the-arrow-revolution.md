Pandas 2.0 with new Arrow backend shows significantly performance improvements
on various operations.

Apache Arrow (including arrow flight) is eating the data science and OLAP world:

One intersting point is in the future container construction or transformation
among Pandas, Polar and DuckDB would become cheaper or zero-copy due to they
could share the same low-level data types and memory layout.
