I read a article on Python Speed about the upcoming NumPy 2.0 release. It shows
the new features and changes that are coming in the next major release of NumPy.
The article[pythonspeed-for-np2] and offical migration
guide[np2migration][np2changelog] is a good start if you are a library developer
with NumPy or using NumPy in your projects.

Then I just realized that the NumPy 2.0 is coming. I'm excited to see that.

Check the [numpy/numpy issue #24300][^np2status] for the latest updates on the
development status and announcements.
