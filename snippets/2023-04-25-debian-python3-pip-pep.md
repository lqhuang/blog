What's a good news! DO NOT touch default Python installed by OS, it's always
considered as a bad practice on the flip side.

> Debian's python3.11 interpreter will soon (>= 3.11.2-3) declare the
> installation to be EXTERNALLY-MANAGED, instructing pip to disallow package
> installation outside virtualenvs.
>
> Practically, this means that you can't use pip to install packages outside a
> virtualenv, on Debian's Python interpreter by default, any more.

Or you could use third python env managers like Pyenv, Conda or other similars.
