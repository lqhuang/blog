Alexis King [^thread] is one of my most advocated programmers in PL community.
She is doing great! ðŸ¥°

Here is a fun and informative answer [^ans] wrote by Alexis for _Why do common
Rust packages depend on C code?_. So I just post it as a recommendation.

Basically, the TL;DR points are:

- C ABIs
- C is your operating systemâ€™s interface
- C ABIs are difficult to separate from the C language
- C ABIs are difficult to separate from C toolchains
