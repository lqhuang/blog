There are efficient and popular successors for Redux to fit React hooks. What's
the difference between these state management libraries? Thanks for Lee
Robinson's excellent article to summarize and review them.

> - **Valtio** uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API
> - **Jotai** is optimized for "computed values" and async actions
> - **Zustand** is a very thin library specifically focused on module state
> - **Recoil** is an experimental library using a data-flow graph
