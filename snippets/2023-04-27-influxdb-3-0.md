Finally, InlfuxDB 3.0 (previous as InlfuxDB IOx) is in GA state (with InlfuxDB
Cloud). InfluxDB 3.0 leverages Apache Arrow as its core data model and rewrite
in Rust, which looks like would be a very promising high performance timeseries
databse. And it adapts SQL as query language instead of its own flux anymore.

Wait, when would we have a production self-host version ???
