OMG. Starts from JDK 23 JavDoc documentation proposed by JEP 467 [^jep467] could
be written in markdown rather than in a mixtrue of HTML and `@`-tags. What you
only need to do is prefix comments by `///`. (Aha, rust LOL)

Throw we know that even Java 17 or Java 21 hasn't been popularized yet. Anyway,
fancy and convenient features (to me, at least).
