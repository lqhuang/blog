OMG. Starts from JDK 23 JavDoc documentation proposed by JEP 467 [^jep467] could
be written in markdown rather than in a mixtrue of HTML and `@`-tags. What you
only need to do is prefix comments by `///`. (Aha, rust LOL)

Throw we know that even Java 17 or Java 21 hasn't been popularized yet. Anyway,
fancy and convenient features (to me, at least).

Update: 2024-06-22

I just learned that Scala 3 has also adopted markdown syntax as a new feature in
Scaladoc ðŸŽ‰ [^scala3-new-featrues-for-scaladoc]
