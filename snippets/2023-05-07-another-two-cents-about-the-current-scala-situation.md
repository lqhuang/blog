Recently, Scala community burst a lot of discussions about the roadmap of Scala
in the future, for compiler LTS support, for backward compatibility, for major
language features, for user-friendly toolchains. Acutely, Kindly and Sharply.

Here are some notes about what ecosystem matters in Scala? @rssh, @alexelcu,
@dspiewak, even @odersky commented to talk about their thoughts.

@rssh 和 @odersky 都认为 effect system 不是 Scala 的全部, @alexelcu @dspiewak 认
为 Effect System 是现在 Scala 生态中最为重要的一环.

Damn, They're all right. 他们不是矛盾的, 他们只是从不同的角度看到了不同的东西,
这就是一体多面性吗.

有一个非常值得注意的观点是

> Pure Scala implementation with different backend

作为一个 Fresh newbee, 对 Scala 3 充满了好感

Probably, I don't have too much experience in maintaining large legacy codes, I
still support new features or aggresive improvements, even research-orient
experiments.

But I also know the importance of eco-system and killer applications. AKKA 更改
Liscense 的事件极大降低了 Big company 对 Scala 的信心和吸引力.

Martin 作为 BDFL, 在 Martin 退休以后, Scala 如何发展依然是不明确的.

个人私心还是希望 Scala 更好, 不要成为小众的 niche. But the problem is how to
Make Scala Great Again?
