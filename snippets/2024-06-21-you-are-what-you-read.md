Thanks to Jim Nielsen for sharing his experiences [^you-are-what-you-read].

Yeah, I always feel so anxious about what I've read and what I've forgotten.

Bless to both myself and all of you: Please don't worry about what you
remembered or forgot. Just keep reading and read more. Good luck have fun!
