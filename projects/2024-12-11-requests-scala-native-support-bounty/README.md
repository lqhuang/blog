Got inspired from Jamie Thompson([@bishabosha](https://github.com/bishabosha))'s dev log for [his projects](https://bishabosha.github.io/projects/). I'm also trying to write dev notes for project _Scala-Native Support of requests-scala (1000 USD Bounty)_, for fun and to share my personal experiences with the community.

## About the project

The project was originally posted by @lihaoyi as an OSS bounty on [gh:requests-scala issue #156](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala/issues/156). I first learned about it from Haoyi's tweet.

Actually, I was quite interested in this project when I first saw the issue, but I didns't declare my interest out of shyness. This partly turned out to be true, as [@domaspoliakas](https://github.com/domaspoliakas) started to work on it the next day. Although I didns't participate in the project at that time, I still followed the issues's progress and joined the discussion.

Things dons't always go as expected. [@domaspoliakas](https://github.com/domaspoliakas) officially stepped aside from the project on Sept. 18, 2024. And on Nov 26, 2024, Haoyi even raised the bounty to 1000 USD to encourage more developers to work on the project.

On my side, I will be resigning soon at the end of 2024, and the increased bounty became a core motivation for me. So I decided to make my interest clear and take on the challenge on Dec 11, 2024.

Now here is my dev log for the project. I will try to write down my thoughts and track my progress during development. I hope it can help others who are interested in Scala Native or requests-scala, and also help me reflect on the project.
