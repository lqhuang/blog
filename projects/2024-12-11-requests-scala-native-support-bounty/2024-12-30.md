As the first step, I tried to upgrade the toolchains and dependencies to their latest versions, and made sure the project could compile and run without problems before introducing any breaking changes. [^pr-178]

Through this process, I also became familiar with the project structure and the major dependencies, and gained a better understanding of how requests-scala currently works on Scala Native, and what might outdated or incompatible with the latest Scala Native version.

Besides, I added `scalafmt` to the project -- just a personal preference. Honestly, I can code without Google and AI, but I can't code without formatter and linter, as they make me feel safer and confidence.[^pr-179]

I also created a [comment block](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala/issues/156#issuecomment-2565001863) to track the state of sub-issues.

[^pr-178]: [chore: Upgrade build deps to ensure compatible with Scala Native #178](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala/pull/178)
[^pr-179]: [Add scalafmt #179](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala/pull/179)
