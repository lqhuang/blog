We definitely shouldn't write code like this:

```scala
class ConcatPublisher(val publishers: Seq[BodyPublisher]) extends BodyPublisher:
  override def contentLength(): Long =
    val lengths = publishers.map(_.contentLength())
    val sum = lengths.sum
    if (sum < 0) then -1 else sum
```

As we know, the summing process may overflow along the way.

```scala
val lengths = List(1, 2, 3, 5, Long.MaxValue)
s"Direct sum of `lengths`: ${lengths.sum}" // -9223372036854775798
val lengths1 = lengths ++ List(Long.MaxValue)
s"Direct sum of `lengths1` will go back to normal range: ${lengths1.sum}" // 9

val maybeSum = lengths.foldLeft[Option[Long]](Some(0L)) { (acc, curr) =>
  acc match
    case Some(s) =>
      val localSum = s + curr
      if localSum < 0 then None else Some(localSum)
    case None => None
}
s"sum of `lengths` overflows, so return: ${maybeSum}" // None
val maySum1 = lengths1.foldLeft[Option[Long]](Some(0L)) { (acc, curr) =>
  acc match
    case Some(s) =>
      val localSum = s + curr
      if localSum < 0 then None else Some(localSum)
    case None => None
}
s"sum of `lengths1` also overflows, so return: ${maySum1}" // None
```

So we can rewrite the implementation to safer and functional programming style

```scala
class ConcatPublisher(val publishers: Seq[BodyPublisher]) extends BodyPublisher:
  override def contentLength(): Long =
    val lengths = publishers.map(_.contentLength())
    val sum = lengths.foldLeft[Option[Long]](Some(0L)) {
      (acc, curr) => acc match
        case Some(s) =>
          val localSum = s + curr
          if localSum < 0 then None else Some(localSum)
        case None => None
    }
    sum
```

However, there is a simpler solution

```scala
class ConcatPublisher(val publishers: Seq[BodyPublisher]) extends BodyPublisher:
  override def contentLength(): Long =
    val lengths = publishers.map(_.contentLength())
    val sum = lengths.reduce((x, y) => if (x < 0 || y < 0) then -1 else x + y)
    if (sum < 0) then -1 else sum
```

Honestly, I'd go with the last approach. It might not be the most "FP" solution, but it's simple, works, and doesn't add much runtime overhead. If the language can't do better, this is probably as good as it gets.

I've been wondering why there are no unsigned primitive types. The value `-1` can serve as an important flag, at least itâ€™s better than using `null`, when there's no `None` abstraction available.

We can do better. Not only does Rust [^rust-sat] support saturation arithmetic [^sat-arith], but even C++ will add it since C++26 [^sat-cpp26].

In the mean time, I just found the dicussion about `Result` type

- [Pre-SIP: Proposal of introducing a Rust-like type "Result" - Scala Improvement Process - Scala Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/pre-sip-proposal-of-introducing-a-rust-like-type-result/3497)

and some comments from the discussion:

> @deusaquilus: Holy S$#%!! In the amount of time we've spent debating this issue a small OSS library could have been written! Or all the needed adaptors from whatever implementation of Try/Either to whatever the heck else we want with similar functionally could have been written! Maybe let's be a bit more pragmatic!?

> @lihaoyi IMO If a new data type will be introduced, it should be introduced outside the standard library, and should fight for its own mindshare separate from Either. Library and framework authors could easily adopt it, and over time if it becomes the de-facto standard it could be considered for inclusion in the standard library.

So I'm thinking -- could I make a safer standard library for Scala 3 by taking advantage of the `Result` type and `CanThrow` Capabilities[^canThrow-cap]?

Hence, I started a new project called [redef](https://github.com/lqhuang/redef), inspired from `relude` in Haskell. It aims to add extra enhencements to Scala 3 standard library , and I'll be experimenting with using the `Result` type as a replacement for `Try` and `Either`.

Then, for math arithmetic operations, we could using the newest `extension` syntax to overload conventional operators. Bascially, the trivial implementation would be like

```scala
package redef.math

import scala.annotation.targetName
import scala.math.{Numeric, Ordered}

import redef.util.SafeTry

class OverflowException extends Exception

trait SafeArithmetic[T, E <: OverflowException](using Numeric[T]) {
  def negateExact(x: T): T throws E
  def addExact(x: T, y: T): T throws E
  def subtractExact(x: T, y: T): T throws E
  def multiplyExact(x: T, y: T): T throws E
  def floorDivExact(x: T, y: T): T throws E
  def floorModExact(x: T, y: T): T throws E

  extension (x: T) {
    def unary_- : T throws E = negateExact(x)

    def +(y: T): T throws E = addExact(x, y)

    @targetName("tryAdd")
    def +?(y: T): SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(addExact(x, y))

    def -(y: T): T throws E = subtractExact(x, y)

    @targetName("trySubtract")
    def -?(y: T): SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(subtractExact(x, y))

    def *(y: T): T throws E = multiplyExact(x, y)

    @targetName("tryMultiply")
    def *?(y: T): SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(multiplyExact(x, y))

    def /(y: T): T throws E = floorDivExact(x, y)

    @targetName("tryDivide")
    def /?(y: T): SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(floorDivExact(x, y))

    def %(y: T): T throws E = floorModExact(x, y)

    @targetName("tryMod")
    def %?(y: T): SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(floorModExact(x, y))

    def abs: T throws E =
      if Numeric[T].lt(x, Numeric[T].zero) then negateExact(x) else x

    def absTry: SafeTry[T, E] = SafeTry(abs)
  }
}


given SafeArithmetic[Int, OverflowException](using Numeric[Int]):
  def negateExact(x: Int): Int throws OverflowException  =
    try {
      math.negateExact(x)
    } catch {
      case e: ArithmeticException => throw new OverflowException
