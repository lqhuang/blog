Upgrade to mill v1.0.1, and adapt monorepo style for future work.

I schedule to split the project into multiple sub-packages around the http ecosystem,

- `scala-native-java-http` for the full compatible Java HTTP client API
- `scala-native-curl` for the native `curl` bindings
- `scala-native-http-core` for the facade http frame packing
  - Thanks for the issue. I have first time to read over sources of `curl`.
  - I thought `curl` provide an good example to build a frontend facade for HTTP client and crypto libraries. Use an unified interface (virtual frame or virtual tls) to dominate the different backend libraries.
    - Base on `core` we may have different `scala-native-http-nghttp2`, `scala-native-http-nghttp3`, etc. packages.
- `scala-native-brotli` for [google/brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli)
- `scala-native-ada` for [ada-url/ada](https://github.com/ada-url/ada)
