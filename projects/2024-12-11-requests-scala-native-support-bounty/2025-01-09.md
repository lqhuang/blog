After diving deep into the requests library and reviewing all the previous work, I think Haoyiâ€™s new idea is generally correct.

> IMO the best way to approach this would to implement the Java standard library `HttpClient`

This approach will also benefit other Scala Native projects by providing an optional, replaceable plugin -- which is something the community has been hoping for.

So, the goal of this project is shifting towards implementing a shim module for the Java standard library `HttpClient` on Scala Native, which is also compatible with the current `requests-scala` API.

I forked repo from [lolgab/scala-native-http-client-async](https://github.com/lolgab/scala-native-http-client-async), upgraded the toolchains, and cleaned up the code. Then left messages for both the [Scala Native](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/issues/4104#issuecomment-2579109077) and [requests-scala](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala/issues/156#issuecomment-2579099520) communities to let everyone know about the new status.

Thanks for [@lolgab](https://github.com/lolgab) for the initial work.
