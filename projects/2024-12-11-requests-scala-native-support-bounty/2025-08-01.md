After few days of work, I have finished the major binding definitions for the `curl` library.

Thanks to [@keynmol](https://github.com/keynmol) for creating [indoorvivants/sn-bindgen-examples - tree/example-curl](https://github.com/indoorvivants/sn-bindgen-examples/tree/main/example-curl/src/main/scala), which provided a lot of boilerplate code for me to start with.

Compared to the gnerated bindings, I try to follow the similar [module structure](https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/master/include/curl) as the original `curl` library and intentionally keep the almost the same order of the symbols first defined in the header files.

```
- experimental/libcurl
   |- core.scala
   |- curl.scala
   |- easy.scala
   |- multi.scala
   |- options.scala
   \- websockets.scala
```

In `core.scala`, we have

```scala
@extern
object core:

  @name("CURL")
  opaque type Curl = CStruct0 // curl easy
  object Curl:
    given Tag[Curl] = Tag.materializeCStruct0Tag

  @name("curl_socket_t")
  opaque type CurlSocket = Int
  object CurlSocket:
    given Tag[CurlSocket] = Tag.Int

    inline def define(inline v: Int): CurlSocket = v

    val BAD = define(-1)

  ...

  /**
   * NAME curl_global_init()
   *
   * DESCRIPTION
   *
   * curl_global_init() should be invoked exactly once for each application that uses libcurl and
   * before any call of other libcurl functions.
   *
   * This function is thread-safe if CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE is set in the
   * curl_version_info_data.features flag (fetch by curl_version_info()).
   */
  def curl_global_init(flags: Long): CurlCode = extern

  ...
```

`easy.scala` contains the easy interface for the `curl` library, which is the most commonly used interface.

```scala
@extern
object easy:
  @name("curl_easy_init")
  def easyInit(): Ptr[Curl] = extern

  @name("curl_easy_setopt")
  def easySetopt(curl: Ptr[Curl], option: CurlOption, restOptions: CurlOption*): CurlCode = extern

  @name("curl_easy_perform")
  def easyPerform(curl: Ptr[Curl]): CurlCode = extern
```

Then merge all into the `curl.scala` file with single `curl` object:

```scala
@extern
@link("curl/curl")
@extern
@define("CURL_NO_OLDIES") // deprecate all outdated
object curl:
  import core.*
  import options.*
  import easy.*
  import multi.*
  import websockets.*
```

This way, we can have a single `curl` object that contains all the functions and types defined in the `curl` library, while still keeping the original structure of the library. By intentionally aligning codes in the order they first appear makes it easier to navigate and compare the bindings between two versions of the library. Thinking about you have open one pane of the original `curl` header files and another pane of the scala-native bindings, you can easily locate the counterpart lines by lines.
