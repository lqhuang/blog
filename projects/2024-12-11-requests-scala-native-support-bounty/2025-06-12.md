I have started to implement all details of concrete features.

There're two notable issues I encountered while implementing the `java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers`.

### 1. Compatible Scala codes for Java nested static class

According to the JDK documentation, `java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers` is a static nested class. The original Java code looks like this:

```java
package java.net.http;

public interface HttpResponse<T> {
    public static class BodyHandlers {
        public static BodyHandler<String> ofString() {}
        public static BodyHandler<Path> ofFile(Path file) {}
        // other methods...
    }
}
```

Developers can use `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()` or `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofFile(Path file)` directly, without having to create a new instance.

At first, I tried writing the Scala code like this:

```scala
package java.net.http

object HttpResponse {
  object BodyHandlers {
    def ofString(): BodyHandler[String] = ???
    def ofFile(file: Path): BodyHandler[Path] = ???
    // other methods...
  }
}
```

However, this approach didn't work as expected in Scala Native. When I tried to compile and test the code, the compiler was unable to find the shimmed class properly.

```console
$ make clean && make test
./mill clean

```

Let me highlight the main error message: `Unknown static method java.net.http.HttpResponse$BodyHandlers`. This suggests that the Scala Native compiler isn't able to resolve the static object I defined. Notably, it refers to it as `java.net.http.HttpResponse$BodyHandlers` instead of `java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers`.

I began searching for solutions and came across two issues that might be related:

- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12111
- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/9714

But after some investigation, I realized that my problem was probably not related to the Scala Native compiler itself. However, I still had no idea how to solve it.

A few days later, I started to think that it doesn't make sense -- using nested static classes is a very common pattern in Java, and Scala should support it as well.

Eventually, I realized that I just needed to find an example where Scala Native itself shims a Java nested static class. Then, I could use that as a reference to implement my own code.

Fortunately, itâ€™s quite easy to find a nested static class in the JDK, For example [the class `System`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html) and its nested static class `LoggerFinder`.

Here, I also learned a trick to find a specific regex pattern across multiple lines. So now, I just need to look for something like the following:

```
xxxx System {
  xxxx LoggerFinder {

  }
}
```

in the `scala-native` source codes. This approach is definitely feasible. The following command is used to search for the above pattern using the `ripgrep` tool:

```console
$ pwd
/<parent-dir-of-scala-native-repo>/scala-native
$ rg -U 'System(\n|.)*?LoggerFinder'
javalib/src/main/scala/java/lang/System.scala
23:final class System private ()
24:
25:object System {
26:  import EnvVars.envVars
...
... # founded results
...
201:  abstract class LoggerFinder {
```

Ah ha, I found the solution!!! I just need to add an extra definition to mark inner class also as an abstract class:

```scala
package java.net.http

object HttpResponse {
  abstract class BodyHandlers {} // for Java interp compatibility
  object BodyHandlers {
    def ofString(): BodyHandler[String] = ???
    def ofFile(file: Path): BodyHandler[Path] = ???
    // other methods...
  }
}
```

After rerunning the test, the problem was solved! Now, the compiler correctly resolves the static nested object `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers` instead of `HttpResponse$BodyHandlers`.

IMHO, I'm patient enough. But how the new commer can find this solution? I think it should be documented somewhere (or not?), but I cannot find it.

### another issue

```scala
import scala.util.Using
import scala.util.Using.Releasable

class BodyHandlersTest extends munit.FunSuite {

  private val deleteTempPath: Releasable[Path] = new Releasable[Path] {
    override def release(path: Path): Unit = Files.deleteIfExists(path)
  }

  // use case: try to test `BodyHandlers.ofFile` should create file handler
  test("") {
    Using.resource(Files.createTempFile("test", ".txt")) { tempFile =>
      val handler = BodyHandlers.ofFile(tempFile)
      val responseInfo = createResponseInfo()
      val subscriber = handler(responseInfo)
    }(using deleteTempPath)
  }

}
```

But .... I guess it should be Missing implementation of jdk again, but it's missing scala ...

Make major tests for `BodyHandlers` and `BodyHandlers` runable.
