After a few months of stalemate, I finally have time to work on the project again. And the Scala Native 0.5.7 is already releaseed XD.

It's time to roll.

Upgrade toolchains and dependencies, then write the first and simplest class `RequestBuilder` for the project. Finally setup the unit test, pass the first test case. Looks good now.
