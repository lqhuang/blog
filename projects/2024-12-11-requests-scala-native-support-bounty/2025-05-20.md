I've decided to make it clear: this is now officially a Scala 3 project.

Maintaining two versions of the codebase is still quite a bit of work, even if most of the changes are minor. Fortunately, Scala 2.13 can be easily supported through cross-compilation, so I've chosen Scala 3 as the main version for moving forward. Will consider supporting Scala 2.12 in the future only if there's strong demand for it.

It's already 2025 -- why not use Scala 3 first.
