After working on this for a few days, I've finished all the major class, interface and method signatures of

- `HttpClient`
- `HttpRequest`
- `HttpResponse`
- `WebSocket`

just as outlined in the JDK docs -- [HTTP Client and WebSocket APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/package-summary.html) and cross compared with [OpenJDK src](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk).

Honestly, thanks to GitHub Copilot, I can write boilerplate codes much faster than I expected. GitHub Copilot is really a great tool for this kind of work, especially when you aren't familiar with the language or the API. All I need to do is verify the correctness of the signatures, and do some style adjustments.

Then I start to fight with the missing implementation of JDK APIs in Scala Native.

```
[153/153, 1 failed] ============================== scala-native-http[].test ============================== 7s
1 tasks failed
scala-native-http[3.3.4].test.nativeLink scala.scalanative.linker.LinkingException: Unreachable symbols found after classloading run. It can happen when using dependencies not cross-compiled for Scala Native or not yet ported JDK definitions.
```

I need to find which classes and methods are missing by running the code and tests, and comment out some of them. Repeat (like binary search), until successfully compile. This is a tedious and time-consuming process.

> So far, is there any way to smartly info user which classes and methods are missing? just beacause I didn't know the existence of tools or there is no such tools at all.

But finally, I identified all the missing classes and methods.

1. Vendored by dependencies
   - [x] `java.time.Duration`
     - Provided by [cquiroz/scala-java-time](https://github.com/cquiroz/scala-java-time)
   - [x] `java.util.Locale`
     - Provided by [cquiroz/scala-java-locales](https://github.com/cquiroz/scala-java-locales)
   - [ ] `javax.net.ssl.SSLContext`
     - No implementation yet
     - May try to implement it in the future on upstream project [lolgab/scala-native-crypto](https://github.com/lolgab/scala-native-crypto)
2. Will try to include in this package
   - [x] `java.net.Proxy`
   - [x] `java.net.ProxySelector`
   - [ ] `java.net.Authenticator`
   - [ ] `java.net.CookieHandler`
     - https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/3927
