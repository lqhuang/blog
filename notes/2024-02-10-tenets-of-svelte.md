Svelte was born with serveral brazing new and interesting ideas for web
development. Nowadays, it has been a mature framework with a quite strong
community and a lot of resources. I'm aslo a big fan and lover of Svelte.

Last month, the founder of Svelte
([@Rich-Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris)) has published a blog post[^10085] (?
dicussion actually) about the tenets (of Svelte), which is an attempt to
articulate the Svelte _philosophy_ â€” their bedrock principles, that guide our
design decisions.

It's unexpectedly pleasant to read and I understand why I'm in favor of Svelte,
which I wholeheartedly endorse most of points.

The tenets are still strongly recommended to you, even if you are not a Svelte
user.
