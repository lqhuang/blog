Though I have enough experiences in Numpy via learning different materials, I'm
still amazed at the detailed and aesthetic content of _From Python to Numpy_.

Strongly recommend to everyone who uses Numpy in work or research, also the same
recommendation to author
[Nicolas P. Rougier](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/)'s another book
[Scientific Visualization](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book).
Actulally, their name are _Scientific Python Volume I: From Python to Numpy_ and
_Scientific Python Volume II: Scientific Visualization_
