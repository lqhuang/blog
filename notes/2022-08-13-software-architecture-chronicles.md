Such detailed and excellent diagrams! I always cannot well understand "Inversion
of control" and apply it in real cases, though it seems pretty straightforward.

This post is a part of author's _The Software Architecture Chronicles_. As the
author wrote: _In them, I write about what I’ve learned about Software
Architecture, how I think of it, and how I use that knowledge._
