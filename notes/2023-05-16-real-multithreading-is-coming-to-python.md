Simon Willison introduces [^tweet-simonw] an article [^article] about how to use Multithreading [^pep684] feature
in latest Python mainline.

As he mentioned, there is also an implementation of `RecvChannel` and
`SendChannel` classes to create channels for exchanging data (?) which fits
Armin's prediction.

PS: I'm also planning a framework inspired from Actor model for multithreading
Python. Working on that ðŸ˜­.
