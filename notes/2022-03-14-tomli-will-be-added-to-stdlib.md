Such a great news that parser library for `TOML` will be included in standard
library from Python 3.11. So where is the simplest `YAML` parser library without
extra deps ðŸ¤”?

> Tomli is a Python library for parsing [TOML](https://toml.io/). It is fully
> compatible with [TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).
>
> A version of Tomli, the new `tomllib` module, will be added to the standard
> library in Python 3.11 via
> [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/).
