What is `mypyc`?

> Mypyc compiles Python modules to C extensions. It uses standard Python type
> hints to generate fast code.

My first view:

- Pros:
  - No other languages (C/Cython/Rust), just gradually typed Python variant.
  - Fast program startup via AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation to native code
  - Strict runtime type checking
  - Develop in interpreted mode for a quick edit-run cycle. Release codes in
    compiled mode. Optionally, include a fallback interpreted version for
    platforms that `mypyc` doesnâ€™t support.
- Cons:
  - Only support major primitive types and part of native operations
  - No information about how to adopt with concurrency `threading`/`asyncio`
  - No generator expressions and arbitrary descriptors
  - Could be demanding when your codes relies on untyped std libraries or
    third-party libraries which will slow down your efforts.

Hence, `mypyc` isn't an alternative compared with `cython` which target is to
improve concurrency or speed up numeric performance (actually, nothing matched
when I searched `concurrency`/`thread` in `mypyc` doc), but still worth looking
forward to enhance pure Python codebase or toolchains runned as single
executable binary.

Let's see an excellent example that how `mypyc` let `black` has doubling
performance.
