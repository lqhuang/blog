Some notes from Henning Schulzrinne, Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science
at Columbia University, about how and what style is "good" to write technical
articles.

> A good research paper has a clear statement of the problem the paper is
> addressing, the proposed solution(s), and results achieved. It describes
> clearly what has been done before on the problem, and what is new.

old, but still useful.
