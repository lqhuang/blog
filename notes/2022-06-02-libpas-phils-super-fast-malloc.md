WebKit has enabled a new memory allocator called `libpas` to replace bmalloc.

> Libpas is a fast and memory-efficient memory allocation toolkit capable of
> supporting many heaps at once, engineered with the hopes that someday it'll be
> used for comprehensive isoheaping of all malloc/new callsites in C/C++
> programs.
