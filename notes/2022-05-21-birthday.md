Happy Birthday to Dieter Rams!

I just know that from tweet of Gary Hustwit[^twitter_gary], who's the director of the documentary film _Rams_[^rams].

Dieter Rams (May 20, 1932) is a great designer ever who belief in "Less, but
better" design. I also post his famous [ten principles of "Good design"](https://lqhuang.io/note/principles-of-good-design)

To celebrate the day, Director Gary Hustwit is streaming his documentary film about Dieter free worldwide a few days.

Besides, I also strongly recommend Gary Hustwit's other films on industrial design!
