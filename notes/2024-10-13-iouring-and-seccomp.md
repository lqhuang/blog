Till now I just known that `io_uring` is not enabled by default while using container (in the past day XD).

> A side effect is that io_uring effectively bypasses the protections provided by seccomp filtering â€” we can't filter out syscalls we never make! This isn't a security vulnerability per se, but something you should keep in mind if you have especially paranoid seccomp rules. [^seccomp]

Fortunately, moby and containerd have already added allow list for `io_uring` in seccomp filters. [^moby][^containerd]

But [@tgross](https://blog.0x74696d.com) still suggest to to check up on if you're expecting seccomp filtering to harden your applications.
