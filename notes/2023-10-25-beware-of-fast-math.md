fast-math is a set of compiler flags that enables a series of optimizations for
floating-point arithmetic.

- `-ffast-math` (and included by `-Ofast`) in GCC and Clang
- `-fp-model=fast` (the default) in ICC
- `/fp:fast` in MSVC
- `--math-mode=fast` command line option or `@fastmath` macro in Julia.

But please notice that fast-math is not free lunch. Use it with cautions ðŸ˜².

Hence check this post [^simon] to see what innocuous performance speedup or
unfortunate downstream effects fast-math would bring to you.
