Two reading resources about virtual environment[^venv] and packaging[^packaging]
in Python (they usually were managered in the same tool).

Toolchain for Python has become more and more "modern", that's a good news. But
ecology of these tools splits a lot. IMHO, I don't adapt Poetry very well
because it seems not enough pythonic. More discussions and opinions definitely
are helpful, it's a good trending, I'm looking forward to the future winner who
has better DX and is real _de facto standard_.

[^packaging]: [Thoughts on the Python packaging ecosystem](https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2023/01/21/thoughts-on-python-packaging/)

New supplemental materials (updated on 2023-01-27):

- [PEP 704 â€“ Require virtual environments by default for package installers](https://peps.python.org/pep-0704/)
