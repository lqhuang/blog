An article of Chris Krycho's serveral thoughts on Zig.

Rust is one of my major langs, of course I like it, but I also thought Zig is
much more suitable for Linux kernel. IMHO:

- small, feature-less but clean and well designed
- steerable panic levels / modes
- easier to in-tree compiling
- smooth two-way interoperability to C

What a great pity that Zig is not very stable and familiar by people at that
time when kernel is open a window to adopt new languages.
