In one of discussion groups I participated in, a member asked

> Is there anyone here with experience in neural networks or GPUs?

And another member replied,

> Don't ask to ask, just ask

That sounds like a wise proverb! I decided to look it up to learn more about its origin and meaning.

Luckily, I found a website called "Don't ask to ask, just ask" [^ask2ask] with clear examples and explanations. Thanks to the author, I can cite it in the future.

Old quotes never die, such as the XY Problem [^xy-info][^xy-meta][^xy-wooledge], how to ask questions [^how-sf][^how-esr], and "no hello" [^nohello]. These all pertain to effective communication in a community, especially in technical circles. Everyone should treasure these principles as gems and apply them in their daily interactions.

Moreover, another group member shared a computer scientist version of this wisdom:

> Don't TCP, just UDP
