In the past, versioning was a relatively chaotic situation. As time goes by, I prefer the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for libraries and dependencies due to clear and predictable (breaking) changes in software projects. For end-to-end applications, I favor Calendar Versioning (CalVer) `YYYY.MM.DD`/`YY.0W` because of its human-readable and understandable indication of the release date.

It's still fun to know that there are so many other ways[^versioning] to version a release.
