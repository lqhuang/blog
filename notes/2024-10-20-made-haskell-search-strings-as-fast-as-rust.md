[Channable](https://www.channable.com) shares a post on how they made Haskell search strings as fast as Rust[^haskell-search-strings].

Ref:

[^haskell-search-strings]: [How we made Haskell search strings as fast as Rust](https://www.channable.com/tech/how-we-made-haskell-search-strings-as-fast-as-rust): In this post, we will describe our quest to create Alfred–Margaret, the fastest Haskell implementation of the Aho–Corasick string searching algorithm, which powers string search in Channable.
