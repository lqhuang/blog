The bad part of how cloud services change the way of programming:

> Modern programming is becoming complex, uninteresting, full of layers that
> just need to be glued. It is losing most of its beauty. In that sense, most
> programming is no longer art nor high engineering (most programs written at
> big and small corporations are trivial: coders just need to understand certain
> ad-hoc abstractions, and write some logic and glue code).

> programming goes today isn’t any fun because it’s just plugging in magic
> incantations — combine somebody else’s software and start it up. It doesn’t
