Simon Willison introduces an article[^1] about how to use Multithreading feature
in latest Python mainline.

> Martin Heinz provides a detailed tutorial on trying out the new
> Per-Interpreter GIL feature thatâ€™s landing in Python 3.12, which allows Python
> code to run concurrently in multiple threads by spawning separate
> sub-interpreters, each with their own dedicated GIL.

As he mentioned, there is also an implementation of `RecvChannel` and
`SendChannel` classes to create channels for exchanging data (?) which fits
Armin's prediction[^3].

PS: I'm also planning a framework inspired from Actor model for multithreading
Python. Working on that ðŸ˜­.
