IMHO, I like lazy imports as a fancy and powerful **opt-in** feature, but it's
quite doubtful about setting this feature default to be enabled in current
proposal.

Implicit behaviors are terrible and obviously will break backward compatibility.

Do we forget the Zen of Python: "Explicit is better than implicit"?
