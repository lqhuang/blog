IMHO, I like lazy imports as a fancy and powerful **opt-in** feature, but it's
quite doubtful to set this feature enabled by default in current proposal (PEP
690).

Implicit behaviors are terrible and will obviously break backward compatibility.

Do we forget the Zen of Python: "Explicit is better than implicit"?
