Though we always use `foo` or `bar` as placeholder for naming, do you know
what's the next? Here (maybe) is a full list:

> foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy,
> thud.

There are all metasyntactic variables (could be referenced from _The Hacker's
Dictionary_).

Another widely used placeholder is the "Alice" and "Bob". And left succeed
people have more choices, some common names are

- Alice and Bob
- Carol, Carlos or Charlie
- Dan, Dave or David
- Eve
- Frank
- ...

Even more they have fairly well-established "personalities" (or functions):

- Craig -> A password cracker, often encountered in situations with stored
  passwords
- Grace -> A government representative
